## Discrimination Threshold

Most classification algorithms output a continuous value that represents the likelihood of an input belonging to a particular class. For our berry classifier, this might be a value between 0 and 1 indicating how likely it is that a berry is a raspberry.

<div id="continuous-output"></div>

Applied to our example, our classifier may output a value of 0.99 when it's nearly certain it's looking at a raspberry, and a value of 0.1 when it's quite sure it has something that is not a raspberry (i.e. blueberry). If we applied our algorithm to the same set of berries we've been working with so far, (4 raspberries, 8 blueberries), we could get a set of outputs that look like this:

<div id="static-discrimination"></div>

So how can we make categorical decisions based on continuous data like this? One simplistic approach is to apply a threshold or cutoff. Predictions below the cutoff are labelled negative, and predictions above are labelled positive.

Move the slider below to adjust the threshold and observe how it affects the classification of berries:

<div id="discrimination-plot"></div>

Notice how adjusting the threshold creates a trade-off between different types of errors. A low threshold means we'll correctly identify more raspberries (true positives) but at the cost of misclassifying more blueberries as raspberries (false positives). A high threshold has the opposite effect.
