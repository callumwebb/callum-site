## Hello!

I'm a Staff machine learning engineer working on search and recommendations at Deliveroo, based in London. In past roles, I've worked on:

* Building data products at Bibliu, an educational technology startup
* Financial regulation
* Innovative conveyor belt monitoring technologies
* Optimising autonomous mining operations and copper extraction
* Heavy haul railway maintenance
* Mentoring young people who want to learn how to code

And other software development in Python, Objective C, and C++. Outside of work I enjoy photography, keeping fit, and eating chocolate.

This site serves as a repository of notes and blog posts about topics I find interesting, maybe you'll find something useful here too!
